`mepo` is a tool, written in Python3 (3.9.0+), to manage (m)ultiple git r(epo)sitories, by attempting to create an illusion of a 'single repository' for multi-repository projects. Please see the [Wiki](../../wiki) for examples of `mepo` workflows.

## Installation

### Using pip

To install `mepo` using `pip`, run the following command:

```
`pip install mepo`
```

### Homebrew

Using Homebrew, you can install `mepo` by installing from the gmao-si-team tap:

```
brew install gmao-si-team/packages/mepo
```

This is equivalent to running:

```
brew tap gmao-si-team/packages
brew install mepo
```

## Transitioning from `mepo` v1.x to v2.x

If you try to use mepo v2.x within a mepo v1.x repository, you will get an warning message:
```
Detected mepo1 style state
Run <mepo update-state> to permanently convert to mepo2 style
```

To update your repository to work with mepo v2.x, you can run the following command:
```
mepo update-state
```
and it will convert the repository from mepo v1 pickle-state to mepo v2 json-state.
