## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

### Added

### Changed

## [2.3.0] - 2025-01-12

### Changed

- Moved `mepo status` and `mepo restore-state` to default to their serial variants rather than parallel by default. At the same time, we remove the `--serial` option from these commands and add a `--parallel` option if users want to run them in parallel.

## [2.2.1] - 2025-01-03

### Fixed

- Fixed bugs in the lesser used options of `mepo clone`, `allrepos` and `registry`

### Added

- Added tests for `mepo clone --allrepos` and `mepo clone --registry`

## [2.2.0] - 2024-12-24

### Added

- Hidden option `--location` for mepo that returns the path to the mepo directory
- Added ability to print number of stashes in `mepo status`
- Added new tests for `mepo clone`

### Changed

- Removed legacy `bin` directory
- Checked out branches are no longer in 'detached head' state

## [2.1.0] - 2024-10-02

### Fixed

- Fixed mepo completion

### Added

- Added ability to print version info via `mepo --version`
- Added install instructions for spack and brew tap
- Added tests for Registry and MepoComponent classes

### Changed

- Full path of remote url is now stored in the state file
- Some refactor of component.py
- Removed MepoState dependency in git.py

## [2.0.0] - 2024-08-12

### Fixed

### Added

- Added `pyproject.toml` to aid with `pip` installation.

- Engineering
  -- Formatting with Black
  -- Linting with Pylint
  -- Dependency management and packaging with Rye

- Added tests to cover more `mepo` commands

- Add new command `update-state` to permanently convert mepo1 style state to mepo2

### Changed

- Converted `mepo` to a Python project via the following renaming
  -- Added `src/mepo/__init__.py`
  -- Renamed `mepo.d` -> `src/mepo`
  -- Renamed `mepo.d/utest` -> `tests`
  -- Renamed `doc` --> `docs`
  -- A `mepo` config file is now called a `mepo` registry
  -- More code reorganization

- Helper script `mepo`, used for development, moved to the `bin` directory.
- Added README for `docs/make_md_docs.py` script

- State: pickle format (mepo1 style) to json format (mepo2 style)
  -- If mepo1 style state is detected, print warning and suggest running `mepo update-state`

## [1.52.0] - 2024-01-10

### Added

- Added new `--partial` option to `mepo clone` with two settings: `off`, `blobless`, and `treeless`. If you set, `--partial=blobless` then
  the clone will not download blobs by using `--filter=blob:none`. If you set `--partial=treeless` then the clone will not download
  trees by using `--filter=tree:0`. The `blobless` option is useful for large repos that have a lot of binary files that you don't
  need. The `treeless` option is even more aggressive and *SHOULD NOT* be used unless you know what you are doing. The
  `--partial=off` option allows a user to override the default behavior of `--partial` in `.mepoconfig` and turn it off for a
  run of `mepo clone`.
- Add a new section for `.mepoconfig` to allow users to set `--partial` as a default for `mepo clone`.

## [1.51.1] - 2023-08-25

### Fixed

- Fixes to allow mepo to work on older mepo clones that don't have ignore_submodules in their state

## [1.51.0] - 2023-08-25

### Added

- Added new `ignore_submodules` field in `components.yaml` to allow ignoring submodules in a repo. Currently used for `status` and
  `diff` commands.

## [1.50.0] - 2023-08-17

### Added

- Command `status` has now a `--hashes` option that list current HEAD hash for each component.

## [1.49.0] - 2023-01-25

### Changed

- When running `compare` in default mode, size columns based on the longest branch name of a repo that has changed. This prevents
  odd column widths based on long branch names in repos that haven't changed

## [1.48.0] - 2022-12-09

### Added

- Added new `reset` command to reset a mepo clone

### Changed

- Updated GitHub Actions

### Added

- Add new `changed-files` command to list all changed files vs original state

## [1.42.0] - 2022-03-29

### Added

- Added `-b/--ignore-space-change` option to `mepo diff`

## [1.41.0] - 2022-03-25

### Changed

- Add `--wrap` option to `compare` (for unit testing)
- Updated unit tests for new `compare` behavior

## [1.40.0] - 2022-01-12

### Fixed

- Fixed the output of `mepo compare` to handle detached branch hashes

### Added

- Added `--ignore-case` option to `mepo whereis`

### Changed

- Updated `mepo-cd` functions and aliases to use ignore-case variant of `mepo whereis --ignore-case` by default
  - This allows for simpler use of `mepo-cd` as you don't have to exactly match the name of a component

## [1.39.0] - 2022-01-07

### Added

- Added `--ignore-permissions` flag to `status` and `diff` to allow the commands to ignore permissions changes

  ```

### Changed

- The `fetch-all` command is removed and "subsumed" into the `fetch` command.

- The `push-all` command was removed

### Added

- Add script that aids in making the [Mepo Commands](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/mepo/wiki/Mepo-Commands) wiki page. For Markdown reasons, some of the Argparse parsers had to be changed to better work with Markdown syntax.

## [1.33.0] - 2021-05-26

### Fixed

- Obey config file for no style. Previously, if no style was passed into mepo, by default it chose prefix. This is fine for GEOSgcm, etc. but broke MAPL which uses naked.  For now, if no style is found passed in on the command line or in `.mepoconfig` assume what is in `components.yaml` is the correct sytle.

## [1.32.0] - 2021-05-25

- Adds `mepo-cd.zsh` as I couldn't figure out how to get the bash script to work in zsh

## [1.20.1] - 2020-10-07

### Fixed

- Bug fixes for `mepo save`
  - The command would save the new yaml file in `pwd` rather than at the "root" directory where the original was. This was a bit confusing, so the command now saves at root level
  - `mepo save` did not handle hashes well. There is no reason it couldn't save to a hash, but it labeled it as a `branch` in the yaml file which, while not broken, was in consistent.
