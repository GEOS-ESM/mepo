## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

### Added

- Added `pyproject.toml` to aid with `pip` installation.

### Changed

- Converted `mepo` to a Python project via the following renaming
  -- Added `src/mepo/__init__.py`
  -- Renamed `mepo.d` -> `src/mepo`
  -- Renamed `mepo.d/utest` -> `tests`
  -- Renamed `doc` --> `docs`
  -- A `mepo` config file is now called a `mepo` registry
  -- More code reorganization
  
- Helper script `mepo`, used for development, moved to the `bin` directory.

- Expanded testing to cover more `mepo` commands

## [1.52.0] - 2024-01-10

### Added

- Added new `--partial` option to `mepo clone` with two settings: `off`, `blobless`, and `treeless`. If you set, `--partial=blobless` then
  the clone will not download blobs by using `--filter=blob:none`. If you set `--partial=treeless` then the clone will not download
  trees by using `--filter=tree:0`. The `blobless` option is useful for large repos that have a lot of binary files that you don't
  need. The `treeless` option is even more aggressive and *SHOULD NOT* be used unless you know what you are doing. The
  `--partial=off` option allows a user to override the default behavior of `--partial` in `.mepoconfig` and turn it off for a
  run of `mepo clone`.
- Add a new section for `.mepoconfig` to allow users to set `--partial` as a default for `mepo clone`.

## [1.51.1] - 2023-08-25

### Fixed

- Fixes to allow mepo to work on older mepo clones that don't have ignore_submodules in their state

## [1.51.0] - 2023-08-25

### Added

- Added new `ignore_submodules` field in `components.yaml` to allow ignoring submodules in a repo. Currently used for `status` and
  `diff` commands.

## [1.50.0] - 2023-08-17

### Added

- Command `status` has now a `--hashes` option that list current HEAD hash for each component.

## [1.49.0] - 2023-01-25

### Changed

- When running `compare` in default mode, size columns based on the longest branch name of a repo that has changed. This prevents
  odd column widths based on long branch names in repos that haven't changed

## [1.48.0] - 2022-12-09

### Added

- Added new `reset` command to reset a mepo clone

### Changed

- Updated GitHub Actions

## [1.47.0] - 2022-11-14

### Added

- Added ability to do `mepo tag push --delete` so you can delete a tag on the remote

## [1.46.0] - 2022-10-18

### Added

- Add new `changed-files` command to list all changed files vs original state

## [1.45.0] - 2022-08-10

### Changed

- Changed StateDoesNotExistError and StateAlreadyInitializedError to be subclasses of `SystemExit`
- Changed some git subcommands to use full local path

## [1.42.0] - 2022-03-29

### Added

- Added `-b/--ignore-space-change` option to `mepo diff`

## [1.41.0] - 2022-03-25

### Changed

- Changed the default behavior of `compare` to only show differing repos. Use `--all` to see all repos
- Add `--nocolor` option to `status` and `compare` (for unit testing)
- Add `--wrap` option to `compare` (for unit testing)
- Updated unit tests for new `compare` behavior

## [1.40.0] - 2022-01-12

### Fixed

- Fixed the output of `mepo compare` to handle detached branch hashes

### Added

- Added `--ignore-case` option to `mepo whereis`

### Changed

- Updated `mepo-cd` functions and aliases to use ignore-case variant of `mepo whereis --ignore-case` by default
  - This allows for simpler use of `mepo-cd` as you don't have to exactly match the name of a component

## [1.39.0] - 2022-01-07

### Added

- Added `--ignore-permissions` flag to `status` and `diff` to allow the commands to ignore permissions changes
- Add `--name-status` flag to `mepo diff`

### Changed

- When running `mepo compare` and `mepo status`, detatched branches will also display the commit id:

  ```
  GEOSgcm_GridComp       | (b) feature/aogcm (DH, 0793f7b2)
  ```

- GitHub Actions updates
  - Uses `pypy-3.8` specifically

### Changed

- The `push-all` command was removed

### Added

- Add script that aids in making the [Mepo Commands](https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/mepo/wiki/Mepo-Commands) wiki page. For Markdown reasons, some of the Argparse parsers had to be changed to better work with Markdown syntax.

## [1.33.0] - 2021-05-26

### Fixed

- Obey config file for no style. Previously, if no style was passed into mepo, by default it chose prefix. This is fine for GEOSgcm, etc. but broke MAPL which uses naked.  For now, if no style is found passed in on the command line or in `.mepoconfig` assume what is in `components.yaml` is the correct sytle.

## [1.32.0] - 2021-05-25

- A bit of nicety on `mepo status` for detatched HEAD states
- Adds `mepo-cd.zsh` as I couldn't figure out how to get the bash script to work in zsh

## [1.20.1] - 2020-10-07

### Fixed

- Bug fixes for `mepo save`
  - The command would save the new yaml file in `pwd` rather than at the "root" directory where the original was. This was a bit confusing, so the command now saves at root level
  - `mepo save` did not handle hashes well. There is no reason it couldn't save to a hash, but it labeled it as a `branch` in the yaml file which, while not broken, was in consistent.
