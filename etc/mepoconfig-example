# This is a skeleton example of a .mepoconfig file
#
# .mepoconfig is a config file a la gitconfig with sections and options.
#
# Currently, .mepoconfig files recognize three sections: [init], [alias], and [clone].
#
# =======================================================================
#
# [init] Section
#
#   The init section currently recognizes one option, style.
#   This has three allowed values: naked, postfix, prefix
#
#   So if you have:
#
#     [init]
#     style = postfix
#
#   This is equivalent to doing:
#
#     mepo init --style postfix
#
#   or when running with mepo clone:
#
#     mepo clone --style postfix
#
#   You set these options by running:
#
#     mepo config set init.style <value>
#
# =======================================================================
#
# [alias] Section
#
#   The [alias] Section is used to make aliases of mepo commands. For
#   example this:
#
#     [alias]
#     st = status
#
#   lets one run "mepo st" as an alias to "mepo status"
#
#   Note: Due to lack of skill of the developer and limitations in Argparse,
#         you can only alias mepo primary commands and not "subcommands" or
#         "options". So you can have an alias for "commit" and for "branch",
#         but you can't do an option for "commit -m" or "branch create".
#
#   You can set an alias by running:
#
#     mepo config set alias.<alias> <command>
#
# =======================================================================
#
# [clone] Section
#
#   The clone section currently recognizes one option, partial.
#   This has two allowed values: blobless and treeless
#
#   So if you have:
#
#     [clone]
#     partial = blobless
#
#   This is equivalent to doing:
#
#     mepo clone --partial=blobless
#
#   which corresponds to the git clone option --filter=blob:none
#
#   and similarly for treeless:
#
#     [clone]
#     partial = treeless
#
#   is equivalent to doing:
#
#     mepo clone --partial=treeless
#
#   which corresponds to the git clone option --filter=tree:0
#
#   You set these options by running:
#
#     mepo config set clone.partial <value>
